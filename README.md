# Project - Building a Cloud-Native App for Best Buy

## Application Architecture
The following diagram represents the architecture of the app and how the services are connected:

![ApplicationArchitecture](ApplicationArchitecture.png)

## Application and Architecture Explanation
The architecture represents receiving orders and completing them for Best Buy. Below is an explanation of how the services interact:

1. **Store-Front**: Used by employees to add orders to the cart. Orders are sent to `order-service` via a managed backend service (Azure Service Bus).
2. **Product-Service**: Acts as a database for all products Best Buy sells. The `store-front` fetches products from this service.
3. **Store-Admin**: Used by the company to manage products and complete orders. It connects to `product-service` to add new products and `makeline-service` to store completed orders in the **Order Database** (MongoDB).
4. **AI-Service**: Helps generate descriptions and images for new products. It integrates with `store-admin`, using Azure OpenAI services (DALL-E-3 and GPT-4) to generate content.
5. **Order-Service**: Order-service sends the order to order queue for them to be completed. 

## Deployment Instructions
To deploy the architecture, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is used. Follow these steps:

### Setting Up the Cluster
1. Create a resource group in Azure Portal (e.g., **Project2**).
2. Configure an AKS cluster:
   - 1 system node
   - 2 worker nodes
   - Manual scaling enabled

### Configuring AI Services
1. Deploy Azure OpenAI resources in the same resource group.
2. Add two deployments:
   - **GPT-4** for generating descriptions.
   - **DALL-E-3** for generating images.
3. Obtain the endpoint and API key:
   - Add the endpoint to the environment variables of the `ai-service` in `bestbuy-all-in-one.yaml`.
   - Base64 encode the API key using:
     ```bash
     echo -n "key" | base64
     ```
   - Add the encoded value to `secrets.yaml`.

### Deploying Services
1. Connect to the AKS cluster via Azure Portal using the provided commands.
2. Switch to the directory containing the deployment files.
3. Apply the configuration files:
   - Deploy config maps and secrets:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f config-maps.yaml
     kubectl apply -f secrets.yaml
     ```
   - Deploy all services using:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f bestbuy-all-in-one.yaml
     ```
4. Expose `store-front` and `store-admin` services via Load Balancer. Access them using the IP addresses provided in the Azure Portal under Services > Ingress.

### Deploying Individual Services
Each service can be deployed individually using its specific YAML file:
```bash
kubectl apply -f <service-specific-file>.yaml
```

## Bonus Task: Implement a CI/CD Pipeline for Each Microservice

The CI/CD pipeline ensures that a new Docker image is pushed and deployed as a container without causing any downtime. To implement the pipeline, secrets and variables must first be configured in each repository.

### Steps to Add Secrets and Variables
1. Navigate to the **Settings** of each GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Secrets and Variables** â†’ **Actions**.
3. Add the following **secrets**:
   - **DOCKER_USERNAME**: My Docker username.
   - **DOCKER_PASSWORD**: My Docker password.
   - **KUBE_CONFIG_DATA**: Obtained by running the following commands:
     ```bash
     kubectl config view --minify --flatten --output yaml > kube_config_minimal.yaml
     cat kube_config_minimal.yaml | base64 -w 0 > kube_config_base64.txt
     ```
4. Add the following **variables**:
   - **CONTAINER_NAME**: Name of the container, e.g., `store-admin`.
   - **DEPLOYMENT_NAME**: Name of the deployment, e.g., `store-admin`.
   - **DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME**: Name of the new Docker image to be created after a GitHub push.

## Issues or Limitations in the Implementation

### Azure Service Bus Integration
I faced challenges connecting services using Azure Service Bus. Despite making the following adjustments, the solution did not work:
- Modified Dockerfiles to include environment variables for Azure Service Bus.
- Updated `order-service` and `makeline-service` to use the base64-encoded secret for Azure Service Bus from `secrets.yaml`.

As a workaround, I switched to **RabbitMQ**, which successfully connected the services.

### Quota Limitation for DALL-E-3
When I was initially doing the deployment, my pod kept crashing for AI-Service and it was showing "CrashLoopBackOff" error in AKS. After research, I figured the image might not be built properly or maybe the Open AI resource was not properly deployed. After rebuilding the image, when I went into deploying the dall-e-3 version again, it showed me that I had insufficient quota. 

In order to overcome this, I tried creating the Open AI resource under my student subscription, and also tried creating AKS cluster under student subscription but the AKS cluster did not work properly as we can not choose 2 workernodes in it. 
So I tried deploying the AKS cluster and open AI in 2 different subscriptions. When I was generating the image and description for new product it did not work.
To overcome this I used kubectl logs "pod name" which showed me that there was an authorization problem. 

The Open AI resource was then deployed in the CDO subscription but since I had insufficient quota I could not deploy dall-e-3 and could only do dall-e-2 but when I chose dall-e-2 gpt-4 could not be deployed as they were available in different region so I chose dall-e-2 and gpt-40 and then that worked for me.

### Kube Config Data Length Issue
When adding `KUBE_CONFIG_DATA` to GitHub, the data length was too long as it included all clusters. To resolve this, I extracted data for the current cluster using:
```bash
kubectl config view --minify --flatten --output yaml > kube_config_minimal.yaml
cat kube_config_minimal.yaml | base64 -w 0 > kube_config_base64.txt
```

### Bonus: Deployment fail for some services
I deleted the AKS cluster after 1-2 services to avoid any charges, because I had to do multiple attempts in making AKS, I wanted to minimize the cost as much as I could that is why some services might show deployment failed.
